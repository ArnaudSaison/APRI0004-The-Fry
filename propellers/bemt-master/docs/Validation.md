This code and the different solvers where quickly validated against some
experimental data from the literature (Caradonna, Hefner,...).

Although, no extensive validation and analysis of edge-cases was conducted. A
proper validation of that type will be done at a later point (see
[Roadmap](docs/Roadmap.md)).

The results of the both validations (the initial one and the extensive one) will
be presented here at a later point.
